# SkyBloom

**SkyBloom** is a Stardew-inspired sandbox adventure where players cultivate life on floating islands! Master procedural farming, interact with a cast of unique NPCs, and uncover the mystery of the floating world through a narrative-driven Story Mode.

---

## 🚀 Core Gameplay

* **Movement**: 2D-axis movement involving character manipulation along the (X) horizontal and (Y) vertical axes based on player input.
* **Environmental Storytelling**: Implementation of dynamic NPC events where player choices impact the game outcome.
* **Modular Combat**: A flexible and simple system to combat monsters and defend your floating island.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

* **Engine**: Godot 4.x (GDScript)
* **Architecture**: Finite State Machine (FSM) for modular player and NPC behavior.
* **Input Management**: Centralized static input wrapper for decoupled control logic.
* **Status**: 🏗️ **IN PROGRESS**

## 🎓 Key Learning Outcomes

Developing SkyBloom serves as a practical application of concepts discussed in my **Object-Oriented Programming** research. Key takeaways include:

1. **State-Driven Design**: Using a `NodeStateMachine` to manage complex animation and physics transitions.
2. **Decoupling Logic**: Implementing static event classes to separate input handling from character behavior.
