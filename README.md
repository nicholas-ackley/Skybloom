**SkyBloom** is a Stardew-inspired sandbox adventure where players cultivate life on floating islands! Master procedural farming, interact with a cast of unique NPCs, and uncover the mystery of the floating world through a narrative-driven Story Mode.

## 🚀 Core Gameplay

* **Movement**: 2d-axis movement involves manipulating a character or object's position along the (X) horizontal and (Y) vertical axes based on player input, typically managed using - Link: Input.GetAxis https://discussions.unity.com/t/2d-movement-with-axis/207240
* **Environmental Storytelling**: Implement dynamic NPC events, based on what the player does will change the outcome of the game!
* **Modular Combat**: A flexible, but simple way to combat monsters and defend your island!

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

* **Engine**: Godot 4.x (GDScript)
* **Architecture**: Finite State Machine (FSM) for modular player and NPC behavior.
* **Input Management**: Centralized static input wrapper for decoupled control logic.
* **Status**:  **IN PROGRESS...**

## What I'm Learning!

Developing SkyBloom served as a practical application of the concepts discussed in my **Object-Oriented Programming** research. Key takeaways included:

1. **State-Driven Design**: Using a `NodeStateMachine` to manage complex animation and physics transitions.
2. **RESOURCES**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0lsREGdmc - https://libresprite.github.io/#!/
